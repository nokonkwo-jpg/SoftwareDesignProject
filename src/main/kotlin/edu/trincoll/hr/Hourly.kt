// Hourly class should extend the Employee class. That means
// its constructor should take a name of type String and an id of type Int,
// and pass them to the Employee constructor.
//
// It also should have:
//   - a "rate" field of type Double
//   - a "hours" field of type Double, with a default value of 80.0
//
// It should override the pay() method to return the rate times the hours.
//
// It should override the toString method to return a string with the
// name, id, rate, and hours of the employee.
